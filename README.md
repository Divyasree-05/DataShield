# DATASHIELD

DataShield is a project that provides implementations of error detection and correction techniques. It is designed to help developers integrate checksum, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), Hamming Code, and two-dimensional parity error detection into their applications. These techniques are widely used in communication systems and data storage to ensure data integrity.

# FEATURES

1.Checksum: Validate data integrity using simple checksum algorithms.

2.Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): Detect errors with efficient polynomial-based CRC technique.

3.Hamming Code: Perform error detection and correction for single-bit errors.

4.Two-Dimensional Parity: Detect errors using a 2D parity matrix
